# Old-MoonGS

Modified raider ported to other fortnite versions.
This is really old, broken, and messy but you can use it to learn.
Much gameplay is fixed but you will have to fix the movement and the desync on your own on season 5+.
Someone wanted to leak it and get credits for its own so there it is for yall. He had that version so Ill release that specific one, not a more recent one, nor the latest.
Have fun skidding this.
